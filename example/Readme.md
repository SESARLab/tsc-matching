##### Examples


Folder "Example" contains all artifacts related to Examples 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. 
These three examples represent an example of CM Template, an example of CM Instance, and an example of Certificate, respectively. Other examples that we have used in the context of the CUMULUS project are available [here](https://github.com/fgaudenzi/TBprototypeInstallation)

Example 3.1 and Example 3.2 have the same structure, they are composed of four files:


* **property.txt** contains the property to be certified;
* **tocs.xml** contains the information about ToC (including mechanisms and services);
* **model.xml** contains an XML representation of the STS model;
* **evidence.xml** contains the test cases which drive the evaluation.

The four files contribute to the definition of the CM Template and CM Instance in Example 3.1 and Example 3.2, respectively.

Example 3.3 enriches Example 3.1 and Example 3.2 with:

* **ws.txt** that specifies the url where the service is available.
* **evidenceCertificate.xml** that contains the results of the test case execution.

Each subfolder (i.e., example3_1, example3_2, example3_3) contains a more detailed description of each example.
