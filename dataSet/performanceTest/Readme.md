##### Performance Data Sets

It contains all datasets used to test the performance of our validation algorithm. We used a dataset with depth 5 and it is organized by width (from 1 to 20) to test the impact of validation algorithm at different widths.

We have added an extra directory [perfN](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/dataSet/performanceTest/deep-5/perfN) with all the performance results of the k-matching algorithm on the datasets. File names are organized as euk[kvalue]cm[model-width].txt for the k-matching algorithm and as eusastivaeuK6cm[model-width]p.txt for the exaustive.
