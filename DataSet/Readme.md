##### Data sets

All data sets are contained in the [DataSet](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet) folder. It is organized in two main subdfolders:

 1. **[RecallTest](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/RecallTest)** subdfolder contains all data sets we have used for the evaluation of our approach based on positive and negative recall.
 2. **[PerformanceTest](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/performanceTest)** that contains all the data sets where we have run our performance tests.
 3. An additional subfolder **[Mechanism](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/mechanism)** presents the mechanism hierarchies we have used to create all datasets in our experiments.
