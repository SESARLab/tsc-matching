##### Data sets

All data sets are contained in the [DataSet](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet) folder. It is organized in two main subdirectories:

 1. **[RecallTest](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/recalltest)** which contains all the data sets we have used for positive and negative recall.
 2. **[PerformanceTest](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/performanceTest)** that contains all the data sets where we have run our performance tests.
 3. **[Mechanism]https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/mechanism)** contains the mechanism hierarchy we have used to create all data sets.
