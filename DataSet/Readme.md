##### Data sets

[DataSet](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matchis organized in two main subfolders as follows:

 1. Subfolder **[RecallTest](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/RecallTest)** contains all datasets we have used for the evaluation of our approach based on positive and negative recall.
 2. Subfolder **[PerformanceTest](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/performanceTest)** contains all datasets for testing the performance of our approach.
 3. An additional subfolder **[Mechanism](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/mechanism)** presents the mechanism hierarchies we have used to create all datasets in our experiments.
