##### Recall DataSet

RecallTest is organzed by two subfloders. Both of them use different mechanisms hierarchy (all mecanism are contained in [mehcanism](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/mechanism) folder) in oder to have different match per flow.

1. **[Positive Recall](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/RecallTest/positive%20recall)** contains 1140 instances that provide a right match with their templates.
2. **[Negative Recall](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/RecallTest/negative%20recall)** contains 1140 instances modifies from the 1440 from Positive Recall in order to be deny the match of each instance with its own template.

[Positive Recall](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/RecallTest/positive%20recall) is organized on three groups characterized as follows:
- [Group 1](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/RecallTest/positive%20recall/group1) is characterized by CM Instances having an average match per flow of 2.49 with variance 0.13;
- [Group 2](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/RecallTest/positive%20recall/group2) is characterized by CM Instances having an average match per flow of 1.38 and variance 0.06;
- [Group 3](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/RecallTest/positive%20recall/group3) is characterized by CM Instances having an average match per flow of  1.11 and variance 0.01.
