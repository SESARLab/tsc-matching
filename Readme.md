##### Authors: Marco Anisetti, Claudio A. Ardagna, Ernesto Damiani, Filippo Gaudenzi

This repository presents additional information for reviewers and readers of the paper titled "A semi-automatic and trustworthy scheme for certificate life cycle management in the cloud".

It is organized in two main folders containing all building blocks and datasets at the basis of experimental evaluation and examples in the paper.

- Folder [DataSet](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet) contains all data sets we have used for evaluation based on positive and negative recall, and performance testing.
- Folder [Example](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/example) contains the details and artifacts of all examples discussed in the paper (i.e., Example 3.1, Example 3.2, Example 3.3).



Folder [DataSet](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet) is organized in two main subfloders as follows:
 1. Subfolder **[RecallTest](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/DataSet/recallTest)** contains all the data sets we have used for the evaluation of our approach based on positive and negative recall.
 2. Subfolder **[PerformanceTest](https://github.com/SESARLab/tsc-matching/tree/master/dataSet/performanceTest)** contains all data sets for testing the different matching algorithm performances.
